# Technical Debt

This document tracks technical debt that is not critical for the initial production launch but should be addressed in future iterations of the project.

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite

-   **Description:** The current test suite is minimal and does not provide adequate coverage for all critical components of the application.
-   **Impact:** This increases the risk of regressions and makes it more difficult to refactor code with confidence.
-   **Plan:**
    -   [ ] Implement a comprehensive unit and integration testing strategy using a framework like Jest or Vitest.
    -   [ ] Write tests for all critical components, including authentication, database queries, and API endpoints.
    -   [ ] Integrate the test suite into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that all new code is automatically tested.
-   **Priority:** HIGH
-   **Status:** Not Started
