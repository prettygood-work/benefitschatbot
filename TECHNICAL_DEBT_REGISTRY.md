## üî¥ Critical Technical Debt

### DEBT-001: Authentication Implementation Instability
**Created**: 2025-07-31  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Est. Hours**: 8-12  
**Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED

**Description**: 
Multiple attempts to implement Stack Auth resulted in various broken implementations due to misunderstanding Next.js 15 requirements and PPR conflicts.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Next.js 15 requires route handlers to ALWAYS return a Response object
2. PPR (Partial Pre-rendering) conflicts with authentication that uses cookies
3. Stack Auth handler pattern unclear/undocumented for Next.js 15

**Current Resolution**: 
- Disabled PPR in next.config.js (2025-07-31)
- Ensured handler always returns Response object
- Temporary handler implementation - needs proper Stack Auth integration

**What Happened**:
1. Started with incorrect handler pattern: `export const { GET, POST } = stackServerApp`
2. Overcomplicated with custom error handling wrapper
3. Didn't understand Next.js 15 async params requirement
4. Missed the `fullPage: true` requirement
5. Didn't pass `routeProps` explicitly (Next.js 15 breaking change)
6. Failed to recognize "No response is returned" meant literally no Response object
7. Ignored PPR prerender warnings as harmless when they indicated fundamental issue
8. Spent hours on complex solutions when simple fix was available

**Impact**:
- Authentication redirect loops
- Unable to sign in to platform
- Blocked testing of document upload feature
- Lost significant development time

**Files Affected**:
- `/app/handler/[...stack]/route.ts` - Multiple rewrites
- `/middleware.ts` - Simplified but may need proper auth checks
- `/app/(auth)/stack-auth.ts` - May have unnecessary complexity

**Remediation Plan**:
1. ‚úÖ Ensure handler returns Response (completed)
2. ‚úÖ Disable PPR until pages adapted (completed)
3. Implement proper Stack Auth handler when documentation available
4. Add comprehensive tests for auth flow
5. Document the correct pattern clearly
6. Add monitoring for auth failures
7. Re-enable PPR after adapting pages to work with it

### DEBT-002: Missing Database Row-Level Security (RLS)
**Created**: 2025-07-30  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Est. Hours**: 6-8  
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 
All multi-tenant data filtering is done at the application level instead of database level, creating security risk.

**Impact**:
- Potential data leaks between tenants if application code has bugs
- Every query must manually filter by companyId
- No defense in depth

**Current State**:
```typescript
// Every query looks like this:
.where(eq(table.companyId, companyId))
// Instead of automatic RLS enforcement
```

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Create PostgreSQL RLS policies for all tables
2. Enable RLS on all multi-tenant tables
3. Set tenant context at connection level
4. Remove manual companyId filters from queries
5. Add integration tests for tenant isolation

**Files Affected**:
- All files in `/lib/db/repositories/`
- New migration needed in `/lib/db/migrations/`
- `/lib/db/index.ts` - Connection handling

---

### DEBT-014: Stack Auth Handler Incomplete Implementation
**Created**: 2025-07-31  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Est. Hours**: 4-6  
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 
Current handler returns dummy responses instead of processing Stack Auth routes properly.

**Impact**:
- No actual authentication processing
- OAuth flows won't work
- Session management broken
- Password reset/email verification won't work

**Current State**:
```typescript
// Returns JSON response instead of processing auth
return new Response(
  JSON.stringify({ message: 'Stack Auth handler - temporary implementation' })
);
```

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Find proper Stack Auth handler import/pattern for Next.js 15
2. Implement full auth route processing

---

### DEBT-015: PPR Disabled Due to Auth Conflicts
**Created**: 2025-07-31  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Est. Hours**: 8-12  
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 
Partial Pre-rendering (PPR) disabled because it conflicts with authentication that uses cookies.

**Impact**:
- Lost performance benefits of PPR
- Slower initial page loads
- Higher server costs

**Current State**:
```javascript
// next.config.js
experimental: {
  ppr: false, // Disabled due to auth conflicts
}
```

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Identify which pages can be statically rendered
2. Separate auth-required pages from public pages
3. Implement proper loading boundaries
4. Use dynamic imports for auth-dependent components
5. Re-enable PPR selectively

**Files Affected**:
- `/next.config.js`
- All pages using `auth()` or `cookies()`

---

### DEBT-016: AI Development Workflow Issues
**Created**: 2025-07-31  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Est. Hours**: Process improvement  
**Status**: OPEN

**Description**: 
AI-assisted development led to hours of wasted time due to misdiagnosis and overcomplication.

**What Went Wrong**:
1. AI focused on complex solutions instead of reading error messages literally
2. AI didn't recognize PPR warnings as significant
3. AI rewrote working code multiple times
4. AI didn't test builds locally before suggesting solutions
5. User had to provide the solution after hours of failed attempts

**Impact**:
- Hours of wasted development time
- Multiple broken deployments
- User frustration and loss of trust
- Considered starting over from scratch

**Remediation Plan**:
1. Always read error messages literally first
2. Test every change locally before deployment
3. Start with minimal solutions, not complex ones
4. Document patterns that work for future reference
5. Listen to user feedback about what worked before

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Don't Overcomplicate**: Simple implementations often work better
2. **Test Locally First**: Always run `pnpm build` before pushing
3. **Read the Docs**: Stack Auth and Next.js 15 have specific requirements
4. **Incremental Changes**: Make small changes and test each one
5. **Error Messages Matter**: Build errors vs runtime errors are very different
6. **Version Compatibility**: Next.js 15 has breaking changes from 14
7. **Read Errors Literally**: "No response is returned" means exactly that
8. **PPR Warnings Matter**: Prerender bail-out warnings indicate real issues
9. **User Knows Their Code**: When user says something worked before, believe them
10. **Simple Fixes First**: Try the obvious solution before complex workarounds

---

## üîÑ Prevention Strategies

1. **Code Review Process**: Even for AI-generated code
2. **Documentation First**: Write the pattern before implementing
3. **Local Testing Protocol**: Build -> Type Check -> Lint -> Deploy
4. **Monitoring**: Add error tracking to catch issues early
5. **Staging Environment**: Test on preview deployments first

## Appendix: What Actually Happened

The authentication issue that blocked progress for hours had a simple root cause:
1. Next.js 15 route handlers must return a Response object
2. PPR (Partial Pre-rendering) conflicts with cookie-based auth

The fix was two lines:
- Disable PPR in next.config.js
- Ensure handler returns Response

Instead, we:
- Rewrote the handler 5+ times
- Changed the entire middleware
- Created new pages that may not work
- Broke unknown parts of the system
- Nearly caused project abandonment

This highlights the critical need for:
- Staging environments
- Better error diagnosis
- Simpler solutions first
- Trusting user feedback
