# Stack Auth Fixes Applied - August 5, 2025

## Summary

Successfully applied quick fixes to the Stack Auth implementation. The application now builds successfully and the authentication structure is properly configured.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Empty Files Causing Build Errors
- **Deleted**: `/app/api/example-auth/route.ts` (empty file)
- **Deleted**: `/lib/auth/token-auth.ts` (empty file)
- **Result**: Build errors resolved ✅

### 2. Restored Stack Configuration URLs
```typescript
// stack.ts - Added back URL configuration
export const stackServerApp = new StackServerApp({
  tokenStore: 'nextjs-cookie',
  urls: {
    signIn: '/login',
    signUp: '/register',
    afterSignIn: '/',
    afterSignUp: '/onboarding',
    afterSignOut: '/',
  },
});
```

### 3. Verified Implementation Structure
- **Handler**: `/api/auth/[...stack]/route.ts` - Using API route pattern ✅
- **Auth Helper**: `/app/(auth)/stack-auth.ts` - Already optimized ✅
- **Middleware**: Properly skips `/api/` routes ✅
- **Sign-out**: Client-side implementation in `components/sign-out-form.tsx` ✅

## Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Stack Auth handler at correct location
- ✅ Authentication helper properly structured
- ✅ Middleware configured correctly
- ✅ Database schema supports Stack Auth IDs

### What Still Needs Testing
1. **Environment Variables**: Verify that production environment has correct Stack Auth credentials
2. **Cookie Domain**: Check if cookies are being set with correct domain in production
3. **User Flow**: Test complete sign-up → onboarding → sign-in → sign-out flow
4. **Debug Page**: Use `/debug/auth` to verify Stack Auth connectivity

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Deploy to Vercel and test authentication flow
2. Check `/debug/auth` page for:
   - Stack user presence
   - Cookie values
   - Environment variable status
3. Verify environment variables match between local and production

### If Issues Persist
1. Check Vercel environment variables match `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY
   STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY
   ```

2. Ensure database has proper user records linking Stack user IDs

3. Check browser console for any client-side errors

4. Verify Stack Auth dashboard configuration matches application URLs

## Technical Details

### Handler Implementation
- Location: `/api/auth/[...stack]/route.ts`
- Type: API Route (not Page Route)
- Methods: GET and POST
- Configuration: `fullPage: false` for API compatibility

### Auth Flow
1. Stack Auth handles authentication
2. Sets cookies: `stack-access`, `stack-refresh`
3. `auth()` helper maps Stack user to database user
4. Tenant context set AFTER user verification
5. Middleware protects routes based on authentication

### Database Integration
- Users table has `stack_user_id` column
- Companies table has `stack_org_id` column
- Onboarding API creates database records
- RLS policies enforce tenant isolation

## Conclusion

The Stack Auth implementation is now properly structured and builds successfully. The main issues were:
1. Empty files causing build errors (fixed)
2. Missing URL configuration (restored)

The authentication system should now work correctly once environment variables are verified and the application is deployed.
