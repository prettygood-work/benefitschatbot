# Benefits AI Platform - Phase 2: Complete Single Company Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **complete implementation plan** for setting up a single company on the Benefits AI Platform. Every feature listed here will be built with both frontend and backend in the same phase. The focus is on delivering a **fully functional benefits assistant** for one company, with all administrative capabilities operational.

**Current State**: Multi-tenant infrastructure is complete with role-based authentication. Platform admin and company admin dashboards exist but lack functionality.

**Goal**: Complete implementation where a platform admin can fully configure a company with benefits documents, branding, and employees, resulting in a working AI assistant that answers benefits questions using uploaded company documents.

Backend:
  - Next.js API Routes
  - PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres)
  - Drizzle ORM
  - Stack Auth

AI/ML:
  - OpenAI GPT-4
  - OpenAI Embeddings
  - Pinecone Vector DB
  - LangChain (optional)

Infrastructure:
  - Vercel (hosting)
  - Vercel Blob (file storage)
  - Vercel KV (caching)
  - Vercel Cron (jobs)

    A[Admin Uploads PDF] --> B[Vercel Blob Storage]
    B --> C[Processing Queue]
    C --> D[Text Extraction]
    D --> E[Chunking]
    E --> F[Embeddings]
    F --> G[Pinecone]
    G --> H[Ready for Queries]
```

#### Query Flow
```mermaid

    A[Employee Question] --> B[Chat API]
    B --> C[Generate Embedding]
    C --> D[Vector Search]
    D --> E[Retrieve Context]
    E --> F[LLM + Context]
    F --> G[Response + Citations]
    G --> H[Display to User]
```

### Security Model
- **Row-level isolation**: PostgreSQL session variables
- **API-level isolation**: Middleware tenant validation
- **Vector isolation**: Pinecone namespaces per company
- **File isolation**: Blob storage with signed URLs

### Scalability Design
- **Horizontal scaling**: Stateless API design
- **Caching layers**: Redis for sessions, KV for API responses
- **Vector search**: Pinecone handles scale
- **Background jobs**: Queue-based processing
