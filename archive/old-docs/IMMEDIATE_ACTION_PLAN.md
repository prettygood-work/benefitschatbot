# Immediate Action Plan - Next 24 Hours

## ðŸš¨ STOP THE BLEEDING FIRST

### Hour 1-2: Create Staging Environment
```bash
# 1. Create and push staging branch
git checkout -b staging
git push -u origin staging

# 2. In Vercel Dashboard:
# - Go to Settings > Git
# - Add 'staging' branch for preview deployments
# - Copy all env vars to staging (with _STAGING suffix if needed)

# 3. Test staging deployment works
# Visit: [your-project]-staging.vercel.app
```

### Hour 3-4: Emergency System Audit
Create a simple checklist and test EVERYTHING:

```markdown
## What Actually Works? (Test on Staging)
- [ ] Can you load the homepage?
- [ ] Can you sign up a new user?
- [ ] Can you sign in?
- [ ] Does the chat interface load?
- [ ] Do AI responses work?
- [ ] Can you access /admin routes?
- [ ] Does document upload show?
- [ ] Do API endpoints respond?
```

### Hour 5-6: Document Current State
```markdown
## Working Features:
1. [List what works]

## Broken Features:
1. [List what's broken]

## Unknown Status:
1. [List what needs testing]
```

### Hour 7-8: Fix Most Critical Issue
Based on audit, pick ONE thing:
- If auth is broken â†’ Fix auth handler properly
- If data is leaking â†’ Add basic RLS
- If site won't load â†’ Fix the blocking error

---

## Day 2-3: Establish Safety Nets

### 1. Add Pre-commit Hooks (30 min)
```bash
pnpm add -D husky lint-staged
npx husky-init && pnpm install
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "pnpm lint-staged"

# In package.json:
"lint-staged": {
  "*.{ts,tsx}": ["pnpm tsc --noEmit", "pnpm lint"]
}
```

### 2. Create Basic CI (30 min)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm tsc --noEmit
      - run: pnpm build
```

### 3. Add Error Boundary (1 hour)
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx - Wrap everything
<ErrorBoundary>
  {children}
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### 4. Fix Auth Handler Properly (2-3 hours)
Research the CORRECT Stack Auth pattern for Next.js 15 and implement it once, correctly.

## Week 1 Priorities

### Must Complete:
1. **Staging environment** - No more production breaks
2. **System audit** - Know what's actually broken
3. **Auth fix** - Users can sign in
4. **Basic RLS** - Secure the data
5. **Error boundaries** - Stop white screens

### Nice to Have:
1. Remove dead code
2. Fix TypeScript errors
3. Add loading states

---

## Measuring Success

After 1 week you should have:
- âœ… Zero production deployments without staging test
- âœ… Complete list of what works/doesn't work
- âœ… Users can successfully sign in
- âœ… Basic data security in place
- âœ… No more white screen errors

---

## Communication Plan

### Daily Updates to Stakeholders:
```
Day 1: Staging environment created, system audit in progress
Day 2: Found X issues, fixed auth, working on Y
Day 3: RLS implemented, testing all features
Day 4: [Progress update]
Day 5: [What's working now vs before]
```

---

## Emergency Contacts

If you get stuck:
1. Stack Auth Discord/Support
2. Next.js 15 migration guide
3. Vercel support (for deployment issues)

---

## Remember

1. **One fix at a time** - Don't create more chaos
2. **Test on staging first** - Always
3. **Document what you do** - For next person
4. **Simple solutions first** - Like we learned
5. **Ask for help early** - Don't waste hours

The goal this week is STABILITY, not features.
