# Gap Analysis & Complete Coverage Strategy

## Current State vs. Desired State Analysis

### üéØ Coverage Strategy Framework

To ensure nothing is missed, we're employing multiple overlapping strategies:

1. **User Journey Mapping**: Complete paths for each stakeholder
2. **Feature Matrix**: Comprehensive feature checklist
3. **Technical Debt Tracking**: Known issues and risks
4. **Security Audit**: Vulnerability assessment
5. **Compliance Checklist**: Regulatory requirements
6. **Performance Benchmarking**: Speed and scale targets
7. **Quality Gates**: Phase-by-phase validation
