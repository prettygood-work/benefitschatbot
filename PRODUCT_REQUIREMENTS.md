# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Benefits Assistant Chatbot

**Version:** 4.0.0
**Status:** In Development

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the Benefits Assistant Chatbot, a single-tenant, AI-powered platform designed to help employees understand their benefits by conversing with an AI assistant. The AI's knowledge is based exclusively on a set of curated documents managed by a platform administrator.

## 2. User Personas

*   **Employee:** A user who needs to ask questions about their benefits package (e.g., "How much is the deductible for the PPO plan?", "Are orthodontics covered?"). They need clear, accurate answers based on official documents.
*   **Super Admin:** A power user responsible for managing the entire platform. Their tasks include uploading and managing benefit documents, managing the user base, and configuring the AI's behavior and branding.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1. Platform
- **Single-Tenant Architecture:** The entire platform serves a single organization. There is no concept of multiple companies.
- **Secure Authentication:** All users must log in to access the system.

### 3.2. Super Admin Portal
- **Dashboard:** A central view displaying key platform metrics (total users, total documents, etc.).
- **User Management:** Ability to invite, view, and manage platform users and their roles (e.g., designate other admins or employees).
- **Document Management:** A secure interface to upload, view, and delete the benefit documents that form the AI's knowledge base.
- **AI Configuration:**
    - **Response Weighting:** A mechanism to guide the AI to prioritize or favor information from certain documents over others when answering questions. For example, information from a "2025 Health Plan Summary.pdf" should be weighted more heavily than a "2024 general notice.pdf".
    - **Response Styling & Branding:** A settings area to define the AI's personality, tone of voice (e.g., formal, friendly, professional), and branding elements to ensure responses are consistent with company culture.

### 3.3. Employee Chat Interface
- **Conversational AI:** A user-friendly chat interface where employees can ask questions in natural language.
- **RAG-Based Responses:** The AI must answer questions by retrieving information directly from the uploaded documents (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **Source Referencing:** AI responses should, when possible, cite the source document(s) used to generate the answer, providing transparency and trust.

## 4. Success Metrics

- **Admin Satisfaction:** Admins can easily manage users, documents, and AI settings.
- **Employee Trust:** Employees receive accurate, relevant, and trustworthy answers to their benefits questions, reducing confusion and reliance on HR staff for common queries.
- **System Stability:** The platform is reliable, performant, and secure.
