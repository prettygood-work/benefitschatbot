  "summary": "End-to-end audit and stabilization of the project after multiple failed cleanup attempts. This audit addresses the root causes of persistent build errors and architectural remnants from the previous Vercel-based stack.",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "ERROR-001",
      "type": "Build Error",
      "description": "Module not found: Can't resolve '@vercel/otel' in instrumentation.ts.",
      "rootCause": "Reactive cleanup. The @vercel/otel package was removed from package.json in a previous step, but the code file 'instrumentation.ts' that imported and used it was not deleted.",
      "actionTaken": "Deleted the 'instrumentation.ts' file."
    },

      "id": "WARN-001",
      "type": "Build Warning",
      "description": "Duplicate page detected for /api/files/upload.",
      "rootCause": "Incomplete structural cleanup. An API route was located in 'app/(chat)/api/', which conflicted with the primary API directory 'app/api/'. The previous cleanup did not account for nested API routes within page directories.",
      "actionTaken": "Removed the duplicate API route directory 'app/(chat)/api'."
    },

      "id": "WARN-002",
      "type": "Build Warning",
      "description": "Webpack is configured while Turbopack is not.",
      "rootCause": "Configuration blind spot. The 'next.config.mjs' file contained a custom webpack configuration, likely a remnant from the previous stack to resolve client-side module issues. This conflicts with Next.js's default Turbopack engine.",
      "actionTaken": "Removed the unnecessary webpack configuration from 'next.config.mjs'."

      "id": "DEBT-001",
      "type": "Technical Debt",
      "description": "Orphaned database scripts and dependencies (Drizzle, Neon) were still present in package.json.",
      "rootCause": "Over-reliance on npm for cleanup. Dependencies were not fully audited to identify and remove all packages related to the old database stack.",
      "actionTaken": "Removed all Drizzle and Neon/Postgres related scripts and dependencies from 'package.json' and ran 'npm install'."

  "nextSteps": "Proceed with updating the AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to reflect the true state of the codebase, followed by the resumption of planned feature development."
