## Recovery Prompts

## Visual Feature Not Working

The [FEATURE] isn't displaying correctly. Fix with production quality:

1. Debug the component render cycle
2. Check for missing dependencies
3. Ensure proper error boundaries
4. Add fallback UI
5. Test on mobile

Keep the visual impact but fix the implementation properly.


## Performance Issue

The [FEATURE] is causing performance issues. Optimize while keeping visual quality:

1. Profile the performance bottleneck
2. Implement virtualization if needed
3. Add proper memoization
4. Use CSS transforms for animations
5. Lazy load heavy components

Must maintain 60fps animations and sub-200ms interactions.
```

## Integration Broken

```
The [COMPONENT] isn't integrating with [SYSTEM]. Fix properly:

1. Check data flow and props
2. Verify API contract
3. Add proper error handling
4. Test edge cases
5. Add loading states

Production fix, no hacks.
```
