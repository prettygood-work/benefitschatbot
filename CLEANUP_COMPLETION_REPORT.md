**Root Cause**: Environment variable not properly configured  
**Solution**: 
- Fixed POSTGRES_URL in .env.local
- Verified all environment variables are correctly set
- Confirmed build pipeline works end-to-end

**Result**: Successful build with zero TypeScript errors

### 3. Stack Auth Integration ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Issue**: Previous concerns about Stack Auth implementation  
**Status**: All checks passed
- Handler properly implemented at `/app/handler/[...stack]/page.tsx`

- Session management functioning correctly

**Result**: Stack Auth is fully functional and production-ready

### 4. Documentation Chaos ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Issue**: 20+ conflicting and outdated documentation files  
**Solution**: 
- Created 3 master documents as single source of truth:
  - `MASTER_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` (complete technical guide)
  - `MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (consolidated development plan)  
  - `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATUS.md` (current status and next steps)
- Archived all outdated documents to `archive/old-docs/`
