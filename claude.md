migrating a benefits management platform from PostgreSQL/Stack Auth to Firebase/Google Cloud.
Current state:
- Next.js 15 app with working UI components
- Multi-tenant architecture needs adaptation for single company
- Chat interface exists but needs Vertex AI integration
- Document processing needs migration to Document AI

Key directories:
- /app - Next.js routes and pages
- /lib - Business logic and services
- /components - React components (preserve these)

Firebase services to integrate:
- Authentication (replacing Stack Auth)
- Firestore (replacing PostgreSQL)
- Cloud Storage (replacing Vercel Blob)
- Cloud Functions (new processing pipeline)
- Vertex AI (replacing mixed AI providers)
Gemini-Specific Development Patterns
Pattern 1: Firebase Service Integration
When integrating [SERVICE_NAME]:
1. Show me the current implementation in [FILE_PATH]
2. Generate Firebase equivalent preserving the interface
3. Create migration script from old to new
4. Update environment variables
5. Test with Firebase emulator first
Pattern 2: Firestore Schema Design
For [FEATURE_NAME] data model:
1. Analyze current PostgreSQL schema
2. Design Firestore collections with subcollections
3. Create TypeScript interfaces with strict typing
4. Generate repository pattern with converters
5. Include real-time listeners where applicable
Pattern 3: Cloud Function Creation
Create Cloud Function for [TRIGGER_TYPE]:
1. Define trigger (HTTP/Firestore/Storage/Schedule)
2. Implement with proper error handling
3. Add retry logic and idempotency
4. Include structured logging
5. Create local test file
Gemini Troubleshooting Protocol
When Gemini Gets Stuck

Reset Context: "Let's start fresh. Here's the current problem: [SPECIFIC_ISSUE]"
Provide Working Example: "Here's a similar working implementation: [CODE]"
Break Down Task: "Let's focus only on [SINGLE_ASPECT] first"
Request Alternative: "Show me a different approach to [PROBLEM]"

Avoiding Loops

Never repeat the same prompt more than twice
If stuck, ask: "What specific information do you need to solve this?"
Provide counter-examples when Gemini makes wrong assumptions
Use concrete file paths and line numbers

Firebase-Specific Prompts
Authentication Migration
Migrate authentication from Stack Auth to Firebase Auth:
Current file: /app/(auth)/stack-auth.ts
Requirements:
- Preserve all existing routes
- Maintain role-based access (platform_admin, company_admin, hr_admin, employee)
- Use custom claims for company association
- Keep existing UI components
Show step-by-step migration preserving the auth() function interface.
Firestore Repository Pattern
Create Firestore repository for [ENTITY]:
Current PostgreSQL query: [PASTE_QUERY]
Firestore path: /companies/{companyId}/[ENTITY]
Include:
- Type-safe converters
- Pagination support
- Real-time updates option
- Compound query support
- Error handling with fallbacks
Vertex AI Integration
Integrate Vertex AI for chat responses:
Current implementation: /app/api/chat/route.ts
Requirements:
- Streaming responses with SSE
- Conversation history management
- Function calling for tools
- Token counting and limits
- Error recovery with fallback
Generate complete implementation with same response format.
