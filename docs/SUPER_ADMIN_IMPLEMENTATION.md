   - `SuperAdminService`: Core business logic for all admin operations
   - Company CRUD operations with statistics
   - Cross-tenant user management
   - System analytics aggregation
   - Audit logging for compliance

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/super-admin/companies/*` - Company management
   - `/api/super-admin/users/*` - User management across tenants

## Security & Permissions

### Authentication
All Super Admin endpoints are protected by the `withPlatformAdmin` middleware which:
1. Verifies user authentication
2. Checks for `platform_admin` role
3. Logs access attempts

### Audit Trail
Every Super Admin action is logged with:
- Timestamp
- User ID and email
- Action type
- Resource affected
- Detailed changes
- IP address (when available)

## API Usage Examples

  "billingPlan": "professional",
  "features": ["chat_enabled", "document_upload", "advanced_analytics"]
}
```

### Get System Analytics
```typescript
GET /api/super-admin/analytics
// Returns comprehensive SystemAnalytics object
```

### Bulk Create Users
```typescript
POST /api/super-admin/users
{
  "companyId": "company-123",
  "users": [
    { "email": "user1@company.com", "name": "User One", "type": "employee" },
    { "email": "user2@company.com", "name": "User Two", "type": "hr_admin" }
  ],

## Database Schema Integration

The Super Admin functionality leverages existing tables with row-level security bypassed for platform admins:
- `companies`: Core company data
