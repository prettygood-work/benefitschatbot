### Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: critical authentication system using Neon Auth

   - Refactored auth to use neon_auth.users_sync table
   - Removed manual onboarding process
   - Cleaned up duplicate users
   - Added comprehensive tests
   
   Fixes authentication blocking user sign up/sign in"
   ```

2. **Push to Production**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check deployment logs for errors
   - Ensure environment variables are set
   - Confirm database connection

4. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - [ ] Sign up with new email address
   - [ ] Sign in with existing account
   - [ ] Verify immediate access (no onboarding)
   - [ ] Test protected API endpoints
   - [ ] Check error handling

### Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
- `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL` (Neon connection string)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_URL`

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous deployment
2. Check Neon Auth configuration
3. Review deployment logs
4. Contact support if needed

### Success Criteria
- Users can sign up without errors
- Users can sign in immediately
- No "user already exists" errors
- Authentication persists across sessions
- Protected routes work correctly

### Notes
- Neon Auth handles all user creation automatically
- No manual user management needed
- Users are synced to `neon_auth.users_sync` table
- Authentication is now fully managed by Neon + Stack Auth
