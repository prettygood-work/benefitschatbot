# High-Risk Areas & Mitigation Plan

**Date:** 2025-08-04

This document identifies critical risk areas for the Benefits Chatbot project and details mitigation strategies to ensure stability and security.

## 1. Auth Handler Failures

**Risk:** Incomplete or broken authentication flow can lock out users or expose endpoints.

**Mitigations:**

- Implement end-to-end tests covering all auth routes (sign-in, sign-out, token refresh).
- Integrate circuit-breaker patterns in `AuthAgent` to fallback to safe error responses.
- Monitor auth endpoint health and set up automated alerts on failures.
- Include rollback hooks in deployment pipeline for auth-component releases.

## 2. Data Leakage

**Risk:** Sensitive data may be exposed through logs, API responses, or misconfigured CORS policies.

**Mitigations:**

- Enforce field-level encryption for sensitive fields (`usageMetrics`, `securityEvents`).
- Apply strict CORS policies to all API endpoints.
- Mask or redact PII in logs before persistence.
- Conduct regular penetration tests focusing on data exposure vectors.

## 3. Pipeline Anomalies

**Risk:** CI/CD or ETL pipelines may fail silently or introduce regressions.

**Mitigations:**

- Implement anomaly detection in `DeploymentAgent` to compare build metrics over time.
- Configure automated rollback if pipeline slowness or test failures exceed thresholds.
- Add comprehensive monitoring dashboards for pipeline run-times and success rates.
- Include pre-merge validation steps for schema migrations and data transformations.

## 4. Scaling & Performance

**Risk:** System may degrade under high load, causing slow responses or timeouts.

**Mitigations:**

- Define performance budgets and enforce them through load-testing in QA pipelines.
- Use caching strategies at API layer for frequent queries (e.g., user profiles).
- Introduce rate-limiting on public endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Monitor key metrics (response times, error rates) and auto-scale resources as needed.

## 5. Third-Party Dependency Failures

**Risk:** External services (NeonDB, Stack Auth, telemetry) outages can disrupt functionality.

**Mitigations:**

- Implement retry with exponential backoff for external calls.
- Use circuit-breaker to degrade gracefully and serve fallback UX.
- Maintain health-check endpoints and integrate service status dashboards.
- Plan maintenance windows and communicate downtime to stakeholders.
