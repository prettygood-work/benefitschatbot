# Technical Debt Remediation Plan

This document outlines a phased approach to address the identified technical debt in the Benefits Chatbot application. Each phase targets a specific area of the system, with clear deliverables, testing protocols, and prompting strategies to guide AI-assisted development.

## Master Prompt for Claude Code

The following prompt structure should be used for all remediation tasks.

```markdown
**Objective:** [Briefly state the goal of the task]

**Context:**
- **File(s) to Modify:** [List of relevant files]
- **Current State:** [Describe the current buggy or incomplete implementation]
- **Desired State:** [Describe the target functionality]

**Chain of Thought:**
1.  **Analyze:** Examine the existing code in the specified files to understand the current implementation.
2.  **Identify:** Pinpoint the root cause of the issue (e.g., missing logic, incorrect API call, stubbed implementation).
3.  **Plan:** Formulate a step-by-step plan to implement the required changes.
4.  **Implement:** Write the necessary code, following project conventions and best practices.
5.  **Test:** Create or update tests (unit, integration, or e2e) to verify the fix. All implementations must be tested live.
6.  **Update Documentation:** If the changes affect any user-facing or internal documentation, update it accordingly.
7.  **Confirm:** State that the implementation is complete, the technical debt is resolved, and all tests are passing.

**Task:**
[Specific implementation instruction]
```
