# Current Project Status - Simple Truth

## What's Actually Working

### 1. Basic Authentication
- Users CAN sign up and log in
- Stack Auth integration works (if keys are valid)
- Role system EXISTS in database

### 2. Database
- Schema is created
- Tables exist for users, companies, benefits
- Connection works

### 3. Basic Pages Exist
- Login page works
- Chat interface exists (from template)
- Admin dashboards have UI (but limited functionality)

## What's NOT Working

### 1. Authentication Issues
- Stack Auth keys might be invalid
- No UI to assign admin roles (just added basic one)
- Role-based access not fully tested

### 2. Core Features Missing
- Can't upload/process documents
- Benefits management is just UI - no backend
- Email sending needs API key
- No real data in system

### 3. Critical Blockers
- Can't deploy without environment variables
- No way to create first admin without command line
- Many API endpoints return mock data

## Immediate Fix Path

### Step 1: Get Auth Working (TODAY)
1. Fix Stack Auth keys
2. Create platform admin user
3. Use new role assignment page at `/super-admin/users/assign-role`

### Step 2: Minimal Viable Product (TOMORROW)
1. Get document upload storing files
2. Make benefits list show real data
3. Connect chat to real benefits info

### Step 3: Deploy (DAY AFTER)
1. Add all environment variables to Vercel
2. Test everything works
3. Deploy

## The Truth
- We have a lot of UI built
- Backend connections are partially done
- Nothing is fully integrated end-to-end
- Authentication has taken 80% of the time
- With correct environment setup, we're 2-3 days from basic working system
